LIVOX use 4-M3 (5 mm depth) screws
ALTUM use 4-M3 Too 	

# Light interception:
- We need to measure the light in a grid of points a couple of times during the day
e.g.: 9 -10:30 - 12:00 - 13:30 15:00

- We could also measure at diferent heights? So we have inside of the canopy too?
- In tomatoes case, we can use the data from the sensors available already + some low measurements
- In the tree cases we can measure in specific places like 1 meter outside the row at the center of the tree,  THINK ABOUT THIS!
- VOLUME we measure at the end of the experiment. Destructive
	- Along the experiment we can also calculate the bounding box


Can you model growth of a plant /tree in 3D?
Can you correct with new measurements and prunes?
