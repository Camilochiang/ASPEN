So current goes where there is less resistance
- If the red cable is connected to 3.3 , the black out of the resistance to GND we can measure the the other (GND?) and it should not give any ampers no voltage.
- But once that you take the picture, the camera should short the central pin with the GND. therefore our input should mark something!
